# Crampy

Crampy is a fully asynchronous realtime web application framework in Ruby. It is built on top of EventMachine and primarily designed for working with larger number of open connections and providing full-duplex bi-directional communication.

## Forking reason
Original cramp was not updated for too long, Pratik was too busy to accept pull-requests.
Main aim of Crampy is to be more up-to-date and compatible with recent Rails etc.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'crampy'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install crampy

## Usage

Updated readme is coming. Now you can check out documentation at http://cramp.in, much is still actual.
